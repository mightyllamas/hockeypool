Rewrite ideas:
- leave initial harness, fetching and scraping in python/BeautifulSoup
-- change scrapers to emit json, not python
-- convert to python3
- replace webwriter and joiner with new tech stack based on go/protobuf
- output of webwriter should be json, and normally only rebuild json for current year.   Rebuild previous year optional if json schema change
- new site templates are javascripted pages that ingest the json and display it.

Need to come up with some kind of schema that can represent draft picks, trades, player changes over time, etc.


Bugs:
- smallpuck not counting on goalie line of team points stats page.
- bug in allplayers.html with position switches
- schedule fetching not automatic

TODO
- support maxPage in NHLPA scanning


- make year of current page in history roster appear without a link
- integrate recent years into history roster.
- pull draft information out of ifhl v2 database dump
- pull trade information out of ifhl v2 database dump
- put in a mechanism for recording trade information in new database, so we don't lose them all again.
- get some backup birthdate information in somehow (old PA?  nhlnumbers?)
- put in a basic daily wrapper that mails status
- mail out daily logs to myself

- parse NHL TOI reports
http://www.nhl.com/ice/app?service=page&page=playerstats&fetchKey=20102ALLAASAll&viewName=timeOnIce&sort=timeOnIce&pg=2

- change player.ini to a manually run thing, and make the player info database more official.   Preserve player info!
- refactor css utility functions, make as much external as possible.

- improve predictions:
  - after a trade & 5 gp, use player stats post-trade for ppg and gp
  - predicted roster shows smallpuck and plumbers
  - manual entry for out for season.
  - rookie rule - player age <21 & gp <=8 & recent games missed > 5, don't count.
- delta in totals column of score roster, so you can see how many games over/under you are
- remove old mailer stuff, and replace with local mailing since baron has that.

Speedops:
- add an Expires header
- put scripts at the bottom. (why?)
- minify javascript
